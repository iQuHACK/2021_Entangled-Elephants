Check out some info in the [event's repository](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021) to get started.

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!


## Rules of the Game

Our goal was to incorporate essential quantum mechanics and quantum computing principles such as superposition, entanglement, and interference to develop a strategy game in which players must use quantum objects and game theory to their advantage. Here's how the game works.

- The board is 11 x 8, and there are two players. Each player has a home base consisting of 4 out of 88 squares, as well as four soldiers and two builders.
- The winner of the game is the one who moves two of their soldiers into the other player's home base first.
- At the start of the game, each player chooses one mine spot on their half of the board.
- Each turn consists of two actions. An action includes almost any potential move, such as entangling two pieces, putting two pieces into a superposition, moving one piece forward, or collapsing a superposition. Moving along a road requires two actions, or one turn.
- The builder can create roads and walls. A player's soldiers can move to any spot on the road in one turn. A wall can block off a road and force it to diverge elsewhere.
- An opponent's soldier can kill a player's soldier or builder if it is the square next to it. When a piece is killed, it will return into the game in 2 moves.
- Entanglement: Two pieces that are entangled can be swapped at any moment with one action. In addition, if one entangled piece is killed, the other dies as well.
- Superposition: Superposition is used as a form of deception. A player can choose any spot on the board which they can travel to within one turn and superposition their piece between its current spot and the new location. A player can continue to form superpositions on the board, and then choose which position to collapse the superposition to. However, if a player form a superposition with a spot next to an opponent's player, the superposition can be measured in one action and automatically collapsed.
